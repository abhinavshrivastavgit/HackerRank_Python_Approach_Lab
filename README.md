# HackerRank Python Approach Lab 🧪

<<<<<<< HEAD
Technical problem solving and algorithmic logic practice for AI Product Management.

=======
This repository is a dedicated space for documenting my technical approach to algorithmic challenges. As an **AI Product Manager**, my goal isn't just to write working code, but to design clean, scalable logic and document the "product requirements" behind every solution.

## 🚀 The Mission

- **Logic-First:** Breaking down complex HackerRank problems into manageable decision trees.
- **Documentation:** Pairing every `.py` script with a `.txt` explanation to bridge the gap between technical execution and product strategy.
- **Clean Architecture:** Maintaining a side-by-side repository structure to ensure project independence and portfolio clarity.

## 🧠 Approach Methodology

For every problem in this lab, I follow a three-step process:

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Understanding constraints and edge cases (like inclusive vs. exclusive ranges).
2. **Logic Design:** Using "Pythonic" structures (like `2 <= n <= 5`) for maximum readability.
3. **Refinement:** Optimizing the order of operations to reduce computational waste (e.g., handling odd numbers first in parity checks).
