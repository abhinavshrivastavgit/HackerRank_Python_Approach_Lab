PROBLEM: HackerRank Python: Arithmetic Operators
GOAL: Perform basic mathematical operations (Sum, Difference, Product) on two user-provided integers.

STRATEGY:
1. Input Handling: Capture two distinct integer inputs (a and b) from the standard input stream.
2. Summation: Use the '+' operator to calculate the total.
3. Subtraction: Use the '-' operator to find the difference, ensuring the order is (first - second).
4. Multiplication: Use the '*' operator to find the product.

PM PERSPECTIVE:
This challenge represents the "Data Processing" layer of an application. It ensures that the system can handle raw numerical data and return accurate computed results based on mathematical requirements.
