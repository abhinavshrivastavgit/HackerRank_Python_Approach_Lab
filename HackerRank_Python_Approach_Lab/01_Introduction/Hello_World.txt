The Breakdown
1.print(): This is a built-in function. Think of a function as a "command" that tells the computer to perform a specific action. The print function specifically tells Python to send whatever is inside the parentheses to your screen (the console).

2."Hello, World": This is called a String. In Python, any text wrapped in quotation marks (" or ') is treated as data, not as code.

3.Parentheses (): These act as containers. They hold the "arguments" (the information) that you want the function to use.
